  				<h1>Idea dump
  				</h1>
  				
  				
  				<div class="intro_p">
	  				<p>Instead of pretending we are some magical creatures, let’s call them unicorns, we decided to step away from our egos and accept the realization that our ideas are not so special, that we cannot realize them all, and that the only way to effectively contribute something in an ever-changing world is to make our work common and available for everyone.</p>
	  				<p>It was truth time. We wanted overcome our own fallacy in thinking <em>At some point I am gonna do this</em>. Because how many of those can we realistically play with and then put into practice? We would love to see others jump on these ideas and breath life into them.</p>
	  				<p>So, here it goes. Our list of world unfuckafication hacks and some product ideas even - for everyone to gaze at, laugh at, copy but not steal (no copyrights).</p>
  				</div>
  				
  				<h2>Positive Design Alliance</h2>
  				
  				<p>A collection of ideas, hacks and tools to use technology for our own benefit, understand its pitfalls and re-configure our minds.
  				Share these materials with schools, employers, etc&#8230;
  				We are actually setting this up as we speak. Our thoughts, hacks, manifest will be available at http://positivedesignalliance.org later this year.</p>
  				
  				<h2>Counters</h2>
  				
  				<p>Simple list of counters. XX days since I&#8230; XX days until I&#8230; <br />
  				Try to sort list in interesting ways, e.g. split horizontally since/until</p>
  				
  				<h2>Kickstarter +Humans</h2>
  				
  				<p>Archive/platform to find and contact all Kickstarters with skills and current job/project. The idea is to structure all projects so that if someone want to start something new they can ask people who did something similar.</p>
  				
  				<h2>Does it exist?</h2>
  				
  				<p>Is it new? Want to create something new? Ask fellow founders if it has been tried before.</p>
  				
  				<h2>Behind the Façade</h2>
  				
  				<p>VR/AR app which looks behind the façade of all things. Visualizes the way money controls us. Who is behind corporations, products, people? And how to deal with privacy?</p>
  				
  				<h2>AI Log</h2>
  				
  				<p>Diary/logbook/journal&#8230; with AI. Look into sentiment, use of vocabulary, character development, which phrases you repeat, patterns we haven‘t imagined yet.

Work side by side in Sketch and compare designs online, maybe have a shared page.<br />
  				/* We know there are now a couple of Git plugins available for Sketch, and they are a good start. Their feature set still keeps us wanting more. */</p>
  				
  				<h2>Open-source ideator</h2>
  				
  				<p>Open source, community-based idea generation engine/wiki/whatevs
  				useful for design camp for kids
  				basic template + learning, best practices

  				the more people who re-create the idea the more learning can be made. mix in different languages, translation through community</p>
  				
  				<h2>Humankind emergency button</h2>
