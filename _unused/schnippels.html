	  <p>There is always some legal stuff you want to put in the footer. Why do we obsess over the end websites so much? I know that people go there in a frenzy - usually when we screwed the navigation.</p>
	    <p>No copyright 2017 or whatever. All code is now pubic domain. Logo ours (sorry, too complicated to give up copyrights). We usually put our work on Github. Our thinking is published on Medium for now.</p>
	    <p>So instead we like to end here with a photograph of monkey lifting up another monkey over a hand-moistening view of the port of Gibraltar. <br />Feel free to hand around and read some more but for this page thatâ€™s it.</p>
