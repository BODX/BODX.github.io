# Open-source, open design, open everything

A network of like-minded folks who work in the open and contribute to the commons.

_Intro_

With a peculiar view on the world comes the need to redefine, or reframe, what we call (design) work.

Work is public not proprietary. Per default we put what we produce, surmise, dream up in the public domain.
When we work for $€¥ we will discuss ways to share what we can, at least our learnings.
We believe it takes a good mix of disciplines to collectively solve our problems.

All research we conduct is ours. The client is free to use it unrestricted, distribute it, but not charge for it, or restrict others from accessing it. Where company secrets are involved we will neutralize our findings and delete all copies of these materials.

As an open-source advisory we put our findings in the public domain and let others build upon it. We believe this is the only sustainable way of working - without always looking left and right what the others are doing, and creating graveyards of knowledge. As a bonus, once our work is free to use, or at least open for inspection, we can came back to it later or move on to new paths. /* There are more benefits to working the public domain which we will discuss in detail later */

On open-source.
You cannot steal our source code or ideas. They are already yours. All of our work is in the public domain. If you want to build a cheap knock-off, there is a community version on Github. Fork it and make it your own. Deviate as much as necessary. Turn it into something else and share your learnings. Make it easy for people to contribute (e.g. Open Food Data). Try to work in the open. It is scary at first but, unfortunately, like all things, you get used to it. But if it’s so easy for everyone to complain and be heard, there is no reason to be mad at one another (for long).

Design has tools to shift through ginormous piles of information, to cluster and structure it. But your learnings are only as good as the initial sources of information. Traditionally, product, business and pseudo-political(ly correct) schemes rank higher. 
One example: As a though experiment imagine we gave as much weight to the social sciences as we do with monetary considerations it even made it [in the New York Times](http://NYT-article).

What we do differently. We look in other places for ideas. We ask and involve different kinds of people. Sociologists, psychologists, neurologists, biologists, coders, strategists, dreamers, writers to name a few.

Without sounding like douchebags, you can expect a bit of uncomfortable thinking. Is the proposed solution good enough? Does it solve the problem you initially set out to solve? Are you crazy? Is it helping you? We are quite fond of insane people with a certain megalomania. 



As a side note, this is what we mean by/is how we came to the term positive design.

But don’t worry, if all you want is a better solution to a list view filter in your mobile app we have some advice for that, too.

In our private lives we preach/advocate the importance to pause and reflect. To look inside ourselves. Get different perspectives. Gauge our opportunities and project many different outcomes. We want to make good decisions based on the alignment of our hearts and minds. We rarely ever do it...

Within large organizations, businesses, government and non-government bodies there is a need to pause and reflect. To look beyond the self-entitlement, the self-serving agendas and narrow path we call success. 
Why is it that when we organize in large groups we neglect the interest of others? Once we found a revenue source we feel obliged only to those we directly serve. To keep the machine running no matter what? Guess, what? There is a way to do both. To serve the communities we use in our marketing materials and CSR reports. It’s called open source, commons, or public domain.

When we adopt an open model for our creations we become part of the community whilst building and reshaping it. It is in the truest sense value creation first, then finding monetization. How else are we gonna create lasting value after we are gone? If you think your legacy is best a walled garden, a hierarchy of leaders and sheep, a bunch of patents restricting access, review and improvement please never wake up and change your mind.

We believe the best legacy is extending human knowledge through free access, cooperatively repairing our societies.

Let’s start with a mind exercise.
Imagine you are tasked with creating the starter package for the first settlers on Mars. The package should contain manuals, rules, software and knowledge to set up a tiny society from scratch.
Do you thoroughly research the best humankind has come up with so far?
Which software and licenses do you choose? Do you pick Microsoft  over free alternatives? Do you think it is a good idea to start the Mars society already indebted to a corporation on earth?
What are the rules? Would you embed the fairest, most transparent system to combat corruption? Or install your brothers cousin’s sister-in-law’s nephew because you father said so?
If you are a researcher thinking _These questions are leading_, you are correct. But keep in mind: You have to explain your reasoning to your fellow Marsians in-spe.

We wholeheartedly reject the classical capitalist notion of ever-expanding growth. At least in terms of the economy and the depletion of our natural resources. Instead, we embrace the ideas of Buckminster Fuller and propose to grow open knowledge, collaboration and an interconnected communities.


We strive for moral truth in our work (according to Robert David Steele Divas, Open Source Everything Manifesto). We want to our work in the public domain so it can be inspected, discussed and improved by everyone. We feel design usually does not go far enough. It is not enough to share templates of our work. We have best practices and patterns but also dark patterns. What happens after selecting the appropriate pattern is behind closed doors. The products and services we design are almost exclusively owned be a very few. Some of it made to delight users, grab their attention, and always have a hand in their wallets (more on this later, as it deserves a separate discussion). We say we adhere to user-centric design but, in reality, only as far as business allows us. The products we come up with are designed to make money, not create value accessible by everyone. This needs to stop. As Bureaucrats we see ourselves foremost as public servants.

Will we be working exclusively in the public space? Probably not.
Will we be pushing our partners to share
Further, we will share the thinking behind our designs and the research findings as much as we can. And open the data, source code, and service designs where we are the sole proprietor, and urge our clients to do the same. 
We want to educate ourselves, our peers, and the ones who own the oldschool economy. We want everyone, especially our fellow designers, developers and product owners, to have access to all information needed to make good decisions.

We define ourselves as decision-support to those who create tools, services and physical things. We bring in many much needed perspectives and skills to get a more wholesome picture. We believe only by combining the best knowledge humankind has accrued so far we can re-build our world so it works for everyone, is sustainable, grows with usage, and will be available even when (patents are used to exclude others and) when corporations die. 

We follow a larger goal: To help build an open-source society that serves a hundred percent of humanity.

Just because it’s in everyones interest, let’s make all//most of our work public and put it in the commons. 
We know there is money to be made, and kids to be spoiled, and party to be crashed, and delicious, heart-fattening cakes to be devoured, and sunsets to be enjoyed in far away countries with kind, strange-looking peoples. We get it. So go nuts. Together with and for others. It also feels good in our bellies.
//More on how to put the most important parts of our work in the commons while adding income sources to it. Most importantly guaranteeing that no one can exclude others from using and building upon it (share-alike).

As a legal entity we pledge to uphold basic and advanced human rights, we will reject anyone who messes with a fairer and more equal global society. And we are aware that the devil will find work for idle hands to do.
In an effort to lower the draining of the global south, we will bring income to humans in developing countries because the only effect way to re-distribute wealth is by empowering people, not governments or corporations, in developing countries. On top of that, for every dollar of their income that they give to local initiatives we will chip in 50¢.

We acknowledge privacy as a human right and the internet as our fighting ground. We pledge to support groups and individuals who strive for the protection of our freedom online and offline, who work towards a more equal and just world.
