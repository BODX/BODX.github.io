# Friends & Traitors

_Intro_

_First, there is a kickass song by a Norwegian hardcore band. _
_Second, it fits the whole government secrecy, spy theme_ 
_Lastly, we thought it sounded cool for a navigation menu item. Yes, it breaks UX patterns established over millions of years. We like to break them where it makes sense (or makes us feel nerdy and warm in our tummies)._
_Oh, and clickbait!_
Finally, here’s a list of people (and their companies) we had the pleasure working with…

We invoke the help of special skills when we need their input. The most popular job descriptions are...
Data scientists, HCI researchers, behavioral economists, psychologists and sociologists, illustrators, motion designers, video artists.


Instead of presenting client lists, case studies/whitepapers, press releases, testimonials, whatelse..., we give and unstructured list of people and groups we consider friends, colleagues, heroes. The traitor thing just sounded cool. And it’s a song from a Norwegian hardcore band.

**Love & Respect**
This is an endorsement. It is a one-sided. Maybe even a political statement.
